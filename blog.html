                Question 4
            </p> <br>

                    Using relative sizes (%, em, rem) is useful when making a page responsive.

                    The images or the text that have relative sizes applied to it will have a dynamic 
                    size depending on the size of the body(rem) or their immediate parent(em). Basically anything with
                    its size associated with relative sizes will enlarge or downsize when the size of the root(html) or
                    its immediate parent increases or decreases.
                </p>

                Question 5
            </p> <br> 

            <article>
                <p>
                    When we said 16px is the default size of the browser, it was implied that it is 100% or 1rem.

                    So when we resize something to 200px, it is implied that if 16px is equal to 1rem 
                    then 200px is equal to 12.5rem.
                </p>

                Question 6
            </p> <br> 

            <article>
                <p>
                    Changes in CSS3 are listed as follows:  <br>  <br> 
                    <p>
                        1. Selectors: 
                        Selectors are used when we want a styling to target a specfic element(s) in the html
                        element[attribute=value] => to target an element with the exact 'value'
                        element[attribute$=value] => to target an element whose attribute ends in 'value'
                        element[attribute*=value] => to target an element whose attribute includes the the text 'value'
    
                        Pseudo-classes: the ':root' Selector refers the <html> i.e. :root{width:100%;}. Second addition is the
                        ':last-child' Selector which is used to refer to the last element in a given group of elements i.e. 
                        div:last-child{font-size:2rem;}. Third addition is the ':target' which is used to draw the users
                        attention to a span of text when the user clicks on a same-page link i.e. span.notice:target{font-weight:bold;}.
                        Last one is the ':not' Selector which is used to put a styling on elements that does not have styling
                        i.e. img:not{width:200px;}.
                    </p> <br> 

                    <p>
                        2. Colors:
                        RGBA: Is  just like rgb, but the difference is the alpha in rgba. alpha ranges from 0 t0 1, 1 being the 
                        same as rgb. The use of alpha is to alter the transparency level of the rgb value.
                        HSL & HSLA: HSL(Hue, Saturation, Lightness). It is used when it is needed to manipulate the Saturation
                        or brightness of a color by changing all three color values. With HSL you can tweak either just the
                        saturation or lightness while keeping the same base hue.
                        hsl() accepts three values: hue in degrees, saturation in percentage and lightness in percentage.
                        hsla() is the same as rgba.
                    </p> <br> 

                    <p>
                        3. Border-radius: this property lets you create rounded corners without editing the original image.
                        i.e. img{border-radius:20px;} or img{border-radius: 12px 10px 0 0;}. The second one is used when
                        we want different borders for each corner.
                    </p> <br> 

                    <p>
                        4. Box Shadows: this property is used to add shadows to a box i.e. box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px solid black;
                    </p> <br> 

                    <p>
                        5. TextShadow: adds shadows to individual characters in text nodes. i.e. text-shadow: topOffset leftOffset blurRadius color;
                    </p> <br> 

                    <p>
                        6. Linear Gradients: Is used to create colors in specfic directions. i.e. background: linear-gradient(to right, green, yellow, red);
                    </p> <br> 

                    <p>
                        7. Radial Gradients: Same as linear gradient but the colors are winded up in a circle i.e. background: radial-gradient(circle, red, yellow, green);
                    </p> <br> 
                    
                    <p>
                        8. Multiple Background Images: There is no need to include an element for every background image. CSS3
                        provides the ability to add more than one background image to any element. i.e. background-image: url('image1.jpg'), url('image2.jpg');
                    </p> <br>
